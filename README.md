#####Reliable Transfer through TCP using DES Encrption Algorithm
#####DES Algorithm
######Data Encryption Standard (DES) encrypts blocks of size 64 bit. 
######It uses Block Ciphers and small key length of 56 bit.
######This pdf was used for understanding and implementing the encryption algorithm.http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~koc/ns/docs/slides/03-des.pdf
